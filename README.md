Henry T. Anderson's 1864 "Civil War" New Testament

# Translator
The translator was **Henry Tompkins Anderson** (1812-1872). See [Henry Tompkins Anderson](http://www.therestorationmovement.com/_states/dc/anderson.htm).
* Some attributions refer to the translator as **Harry Tompkins Anderson**.
* When the Greek text of **Codex Sinaiaticus** was first rendered into English, Anderson's NT was used for the wording.

# Source text

# Status
This is a work in progress. The text requires thorough proof checking. 

## Paragraphs
* The **Anderson NT** is a paragraphed work.
* The USFM files need to have most of the `\p` tags removed, leaving only those at the start of each paragraph.

## Italics
* Some words in the printed edition are style in italics. These still need to be marked using `\add ...\add*`.
