## Modern reprints
### University of Michigan (Michigan Historical Reprint Series)
* A facsimile [reprint](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Testament-original-Greek-H-T-Anderson/dp/1418188247/) paper copy of Anderson's 1864 text "stereotyped and printed for the author" in 1866 by John P Morton & Co,, Louisville, KY.
* Though the reprint page size is 154mm x 234mm, the original was evidently a pocket edition with print area 67mm x 110mm, so there's a huge margin on every page.

# Status
This is a work in progress. The text requires thorough proof checking. 

## Paragraphs
* The **Anderson NT** is a paragraphed work.
* The USFM files need to have most of the `\p` tags removed, leaving only those at the start of each paragraph.

## Italics
* Some words in the printed edition are style in italics. These still need to be marked using `\add ...\add*`.
