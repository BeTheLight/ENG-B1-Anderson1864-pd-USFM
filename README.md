Henry T. Anderson's 1864 "Civil War" New Testament

# Translator
The translator was **[Henry Tompkins Anderson](http://www.therestorationmovement.com/_states/dc/anderson.htm)** (1812-1872).
* Some attributions refer to the translator as **Harry Tompkins Anderson**.
* When the Greek text of **Codex Sinaiaticus** was first rendered into English, Anderson's NT was used for the wording.

## Digital Christian Library
* A scanned facsimile of the 1866 edition was downloaded from DCL on 2009-10-21. 
* The DCL seems to no longer be online.
* The PDF file does not have a selectable text layer.
* Errors (now fixed) in the SFM files often coincided with the locations of word-wrap hyphens in the PDF.

## Modern reprints
### University of Michigan (Michigan Historical Reprint Series)
* A facsimile [reprint](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Testament-original-Greek-H-T-Anderson/dp/1418188247/) paper copy of Anderson's 1864 text "stereotyped and printed for the author" in 1866 by John P Morton & Co,, Louisville, KY.
* Though the reprint page size is 154mm x 234mm, the original was evidently a pocket edition with print area 67mm x 110mm, so there's a huge margin on every page.
* DavidHaslam purchased this item on 15 Aug 2009.

### Kindle edition
* See [THE NEW TESTAMENT](https://www.amazon.co.uk/NEW-TESTAMENT-T-ANDERSON-H-ebook/dp/B07CLJS8JQ/).

### SWORD module
* [CrossWire Bible Society](http://crosswire.org/) distributes a SWORD module for the Anderson NT.
* This needs to be replaced by one made from this more accurate digital text.

# Status
* Corrections are now substantially completed, though the complete absence of errors is not guaranteed. 

## Dedication and Preface
* The printed work included a **Dedication and Preface** after the original copyright page.

## Book titles
* The book titles in the printed work were in upper case.
* The SFM files have these in lower case.

## Paragraphs
* The **Anderson NT** is a paragraphed work.

## Italics
* Some words in the printed edition were styled in italics. These are now marked using `\add ...\add*`.

## Remarks
* Some missing verses have been noted by a remark line at that point in the SFM file.
* In all but one case, the text is simply in the previous verse.
* Acts 8:37 was missing from the 1866 printing, without any explanatory footnote.
