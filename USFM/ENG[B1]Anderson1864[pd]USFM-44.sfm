\mt1 Testimony of John.
\c 1
\cl I.
\p
\v 1 In the beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with God, and the WORD was God.
\v 2 He was in the beginning with God.
\v 3 All things were made by him, and without him not one thing was made that now exists.
\v 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
\v 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness comprehends it not.
\p
\v 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
\v 7 This man came as a witness, to testify of the Light, that all through him might believe.
\v 8 He was not the Light; but he came to testify of the Light.
\p
\v 9 He was the true Light, which, coming into the world, gives light to every man.
\v 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
\v 11 He came to his own country, and his own people received him not.
\v 12 But as many as received him, to them he gave the privilege of becoming the children of God, even to those who believe on his name;
\v 13 who were begotten, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
\v 14 And the WORD became flesh, and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and of truth.
\p
\v 15 John testified of him, and cried, saying: This is he of whom I said: He that comes after me, is now before me, for he existed before me.
\v 16 And from his fullness have we all received, even grace for grace;
\v 17 for the law was given through Moses, but the grace and the truth came through Jesus Christ.
\v 18 No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has revealed him.
\p
\v 19 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him: Who are you?
\v 20 And he confessed, and did not deny; and he confessed: I am not the Christ.
\v 21 And they asked him: What then? Are you Elijah? And he said: I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered: No.
\v 22 They then said to him: Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us; what say you of yourself?
\v 23 He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord; as said the prophet Isaiah.
\p
\v 24 And those who were sent were of the Pharisees;
\v 25 and they asked him, and said to him: Why, then, do you immerse, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?
\v 26 John answered them, saying: I immerse in water; but there stands one among you whom you know not.
\v 27 He it is, who, though he comes after me, is now before me; the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to loose.
\v 28 These things were done in Bethany, beyond the Jordan, where John was immersing.
\p
\v 29 The next day John saw Jesus coming to him, and said: Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world.
\v 30 This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who is now before me, for he existed before me.
\v 31 And I knew him not; but that he might be made manifest to Israel, for this reason I have come immersing in water.
\v 32 And John testified, saying: I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.
\v 33 And I knew him not; but he that sent me to immerse in water, said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining, this is he that immerses in the Holy Spirit.
\v 34 And I saw, and do testify that this is the Son of God.
\p
\v 35 Again the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples.
\v 36 And looking on Jesus as he walked, he said: Behold the Lamb of God.
\v 37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
\v 38 And Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them:
\v 39 What do you seek? They said to him: Rabbi, (which, when translated, is called Teacher,) where abidest thou?
\v 40 He said to them: Come and see. They went and saw where he abode; and they remained with him that day; for it was about the tenth hour.
\v 41 One of the two that heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.
\v 42 He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him: We have found the Messiah; (which, when translated, is the Christ;)
\v 43 and he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looking on him, said: You are Simon, the son of Jonah; you shall be called Cephas (which, when translated, is Rock).
\p
\v 44 The day following, Jesus wished to go into Galilee; and he found Philip, and said to him: Follow me.
\v 45 Now, Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
\v 46 Philip found Nathaniel, and said to him: We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
\v 47 And Nathaniel said to him: Can any thing good come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him: Come and see.
\p
\v 48 Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him, and said of him: Be hold, an Israelite in truth, in whom there is no guile.
\v 49 Nathaniel said to him: How knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him: Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig-tree, I saw you.
\v 50 Nathaniel answered and said to him: Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
\v 51 Jesus answered and said to him: Do you believe, because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree? You shall see greater things than these. And he said to him: Verily, verily I say to you, From this time you shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

\p
\v 1 And on the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.
\v 2 And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the marriage.
\v 3 And the wine having failed, the mother of Jesus said to him: They have no wine.
\v 4 Jesus said to her: Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour has not yet come.
\v 5 His mother said to the servants: Whatever he says to you, do.
\v 6 Now, according to the Jewish custom of purifying, six water-pots of stone had been set there, containing each two or three baths.
\p
\v 7 Jesus said to them: Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them to the brim.
\v 8 And he said to them: Draw out now, and carry it to the governor of the feast. And they carried it.
\v 9 When the governor of the feast had tasted the water that had been made wine, (and he knew not whence it was, but the servants that had drawn the water knew,) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and said to him:
\v 10 Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, then that which is inferior; but you have kept the good wino till now.
\v 11 This beginning of signs Jesus made in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
\p
\v 12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples. And they continued there not many days.
\p
\v 13 And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 14 And he found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.
\v 15 And when he had made a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, the sheep also, and the oxen, and he poured out the money of the money-changers, and overthrew their tables;
\v 16 and said to those who sold doves: Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.
\v 17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house has eaten me up.
\p
\v 18 Then answered the Jews and said to him: What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?
\v 19 Jesus answered and said to them: Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days.
\v 20 Then the Jews said to him: Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you rebuild it in three days?
\v 21 But he spoke of the temple of his body.
\v 22 When, therefore, he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this. And they believed the scripture, and the word that Jesus had spoken.
\p
\v 23 And while he was in Jerusalem, during the feast of passover, many believed on his name, because they saw the signs that he did.
\v 24 But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,
\v 25 and had no need that any one should testify of man, for he himself knew what was in man.
\c 3
\cl III.
\p
\v 1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
\v 2 This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou hast come as a teacher from God; for no man can do these signs which thou doest, unless God be with him.
\p
\v 3 Jesus answered and said to him: Verily, verily I say to you, unless a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 4 Nicodemus said to him: How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother’s womb the second time, and be born?
\p
\v 5 Jesus answered: Verily, verily I say to you, unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he can not enter into the kingdom of God.
\v 6 That which is begotten of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is begotten of the Spirit, is spirit.
\v 7 Wonder not that I said to you, you must all be born again,
\v 8 The Spirit breathes where he pleases, and you hear his voice, but you know not whence he comes, and whither he goes; so is every one that is begotten of the Spirit.
\p
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said to him: How can these things be?
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to him: Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?
\v 11 Verily, verily, I say to you, we speak that which we know, and testify to that which we have seen; and you receive not our testimony.
\v 12 If I have told you of earthly things, and you believe not, how will you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
\v 13 And no man has ascended into heaven, but he who came down from heaven, the Son of man, who is in heaven.
\v 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up;
\v 15 that whoever believes on him may not perish, but have eternal life.
\v 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes on him should not perish, but have eternal life.
\v 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world, through him, might be saved.
\p
\v 18 He that believes on him is not condemned; but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.
\v 19 And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
\v 20 For every one that does evil, hates the light, and comes not to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.
\v 21 But he that does the truth, comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are done in God.
\p
\v 22 After these things, Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea, and he remained there with them, and immersed.
\v 23 And John also was immersing in Ænon, near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were immersed;
\v 24 for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
\p
\v 25 There arose, therefore, a dispute between some of John’s disciples and a Jew, about purification.
\v 26 And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore testimony, behold, he immerses, and all are going to him.
\p
\v 27 John answered and said: A man can receive nothing unless it be given to him from heaven.
\v 28 You yourselves will testify for me, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
\v 29 He that has the bride, is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly on account of the voice of the bridegroom. This, my joy, is therefore complete.
\v 30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
\p
\v 31 He that comes from above, is over all. He that is from the earth, is from the earth, and speaks from the earth. He that comes from heaven, is over all;
\v 32 and what he has seen and heard, this he testifies; and no one receives his testimony.
\v 33 He that has received his testimony has solemnly declared that God is true.
\v 34 For he whom God has sent, speaks the words of God; for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
\v 36 He that believes on the Son has eternal life. But he that believes not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.

\p
\v 1 When, therefore, the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and immersing more disciples than John,
\v 2 (though not Jesus himself, but his disciples immersed,)
\v 3 he left Judea, and went again into Galilee.
\v 4 And it was necessary that he should go through Samaria.
\v 5 He came, therefore, to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
\v 6 And Jacob’s well was there. Jesus, therefore, wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.
\p
\v 7 There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus said to her: Give me to drink.
\v 8 For his disciples had gone into the city to buy food.
\v 9 Then the woman of Samaria said to him: How is it that you, who are a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? (For the Jews have no social intercourse with the Samaritans.)
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to her: If you had known the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink, you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.
\v 11 The woman said to him: Sir, you have no vessel with which you can draw, and the well is deep; whence have you that living water?
\v 12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?
\p
\v 13 Jesus answered and said to her: Whoever drinks of this water, will thirst again;
\v 14 but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him, shall never thirst. But the water that I will give him, shall be in him a fountain of water springing up in order to eternal life.
\p
\v 15 The woman said to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.
\p
\v 16 Jesus said to her: Go, call your husband, and come hither.
\v 17 The woman answered and said: I have no husband.
\p Jesus said to her: You have well said. I have no husband;
\v 18 for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband. In this you have spoken truly.
\v 19 The woman said to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
\v 20 Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where we ought to worship.
\p
\v 21 Jesus said to her: Woman, believe me, the hour is coming, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.
\v 22 You worship you know not what; we know what we worship; for salvation is of the Jews.
\v 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeks such to worship him.
\v 24 God is spirit; and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.
\v 25 The woman said to him: I know that Messiah (who is called Christ) is coming; when he comes, he will tell us all things.
\p
\v 26 Jesus said to her: I who speak to you am he.
\v 27 And upon this his disciples came, and were astonished that he was talking with the woman. Yet no one said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?
\p
\v 28 Then the woman left her water-pot, and went into the city, and said to the men:
\v 29 Come, see a man who has told me all things that I ever did. Is not this the Christ?
\v 30 Then they went out of the city and came to him.
\p
\v 31 In the mean time, the disciples besought him, saying: Rabbi, eat.
\v 32 But he said to them: I have food to eat of which you know not.
\v 33 Then the disciples said one to another: Has any one brought him food?
\v 34 Jesus said to them: My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
\v 35 Do you not say, There are yet four months, and harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, for they are already white for the harvest.
\v 36 And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for life eternal; that he that sows, and he that reaps, may rejoice together.
\v 37 For in this is the saying true, One sows and another reaps.
\v 38 I have sent you to reap that on which you bestowed no labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.
\p
\v 39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him, because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me all things that I ever did.
\v 40 When, therefore, the Samaritans came to him, they besought him to abide with them. And he abode there two days.
\v 41 And many more believed because of his own word;
\v 42 and they said to the woman: We no longer believe because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this is in truth the Savior of the world, the Christ.
\p
\v 43 And after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee;
\v 44 for Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
\v 45 Therefore, when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, because they had seen all things that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast; for they themselves had gone to the feast.
\p
\v 46 Then Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain courtier, whose sou was sick in Capernaum.
\v 47 When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him that he would come down, and restore his son to health, for he was about to die.
\v 48 Then said Jesus to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.
\v 49 The courtier said to him: Sir, come down before my child die.
\v 50 Jesus said to him: Go, your child lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke, and departed.
\v 51 And as he was going down, his servants met him, and said: Your son lives.
\v 52 Then he inquired of them the hour in which he was restored to health. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.
\v 53 Then his father knew that it was in the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself, and all his house, believed.
\v 54 This is the second sign which Jesus did, when he came out of Judea into Galilee.
\c 5
\cl V.
\p
\v 1 After this was the feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 Now there is in Jerusalem, near the sheepgate, a pool, called, in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, with five porches.
\v 3 In these lay a great multitude of sick persons, blind, lame, withered, who waited for the moving of the water.
\v 4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and stirred the water. Then he who entered first after the motion of the water, was cured of whatever disease he had.
\p
\v 5 And a certain man was there, who had been sick thirty-eight years.
\v 6 When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been already a long time in that condition, he said to him: Do you wish to be restored to health?
\v 7 The sick man answered him: Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.
\v 8 Jesus said to him: Arise, take up your bed and walk.
\v 9 And the man was immediately restored to health; and he took up his bed and walked. And that day was the sabbath.
\p
\v 10 The Jews, therefore, said to him that was cured: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.
\v 11 He answered them: He that restored me to health said to me, Take up your bed and walk.
\v 12 Then they asked him: Who is he that said to you, Take up your bed and walk?
\v 13 But he that had been restored to health knew not who he was; for Jesus had withdrawn himself, because a multitude was in the place.
\v 14 After this Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him: Behold, you have been restored to health; sin no more, lest some worse thing befall you.
\v 15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus that had restored him to health.
\v 16 And for this reason did the Jews persecute Jesus, and seek to kill him, because he had done these things on the sabbath.
\p
\v 17 But Jesus answered them: My Father works till now, and I also work.
\v 18 For this reason, therefore, the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he had not only broken the sabbath, but also said that God was his own father, making himself equal with God.
\p
\v 19 Then Jesus answered and said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do; for whatever things he does, these also the Son does in like manner.
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does; and he will show him greater works than these, that you may be astonished.
\v 21 For as the Father raises the dead, and makes them alive, so also the Son makes alive whom he will.
\v 22 For the Father judges no one, but has given all judicial authority to the Son;
\v 23 that all may honor the Son, as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son, honors not the Father who sent him.
\p
\v 24 Verily, verily I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has eternal life, and comes not into condemnation, but has passed from death into life.
\v 25 Verily, verily I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear, shall live.
\v 26 For as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son also to have life in himself;
\v 27 and he has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
\v 28 Be not astonished at this; for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
\v 29 and shall come forth; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.
\v 30 I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
\p
\v 31 If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not worthy of credit.
\v 32 There is another that testifies concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies concerning me is worthy of credit.
\v 33 You sent to John, and he bore testimony to the truth.
\v 34 But I receive not testimony from man; yet I say these things that you may be saved.
\v 35 He was the burning and shining lamp; and you were willing, for a time, to rejoice in his light.
\v 36 But I have testimony greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, these very works which I do, testify concerning me, that the Father has sent me.
\v 37 And the Father, who sent me, has testified concerning me. You have, neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
\v 38 And his word you have not remaining in you; for whom he has sent, him you believe not.
\p
\v 39 You search the scriptures, because in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify concerning me:
\v 40 and yet you refuse to come to me, that you may have life.
\v 41 I receive not honor from men.
\v 42 But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.
\v 43 I have come in my Father’s name, and you receive me not; if another should come in his own name, him you would receive.
\v 44 How can you believe who receive honor one from another, and seek not the honor that comes from God alone?
\v 45 Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.
\v 46 For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.
\v 47 But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?

\p
\v 1 After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
\v 2 And a great multitude followed him, because they had seen the signs which he did in the case of the sick.
\v 3 And Jesus went up into the mountain, and sat there with his disciples.
\v 4 And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
\v 5 Then Jesus, lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat?
\v 6 But this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he was about to do.
\p
\v 7 Philip answered him: Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for them, that each may take a little.
\v 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to him:
\v 9 There is a lad here that has five barley loaves, and two little fishes; but what are these among so many?
\v 10 But Jesus said: Make die men recline. Now, there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, in number about five thousand.
\v 11 And Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks, distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who had reclined; and in like manner of the fishes, as much as they wished.
\v 12 And when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples: Gather up the broken pieces which remain, that nothing be lost.
\v 13 Then they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the broken pieces of the five barley loaves, which remained after they had eaten.
\p
\v 14 Then the men, after having seen the sign which Jesus did, said: This is, in truth, the prophet that was to come into the world.
\v 15 Therefore, Jesus perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew into the mountain himself alone.
\p
\v 16 And when evening had come, his disciples went down to the sea,
\v 17 and, having entered the ship, went across the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
\v 18 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that was blowing.
\v 19 Then, having rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and coming near the ship; and they were afraid.
\v 20 But he said to them: It is I; be not afraid.
\v 21 Then they willingly received him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they were going.
\p
\v 22 The next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, seeing that no other boat had been there but the one which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone;
\v 23 (but there came other boats from Tiberias near the place where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had given thanks;)
\v 24 when, therefore, the multitude saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they also entered the ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
\p
\v 25 And finding him on the opposite side of the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when didst thou come hither?
\v 26 Jesus answered them, and said: Verily, verily I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.
\v 27 Labor not for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to life eternal, which the Son of man will give you; for him has God the Father attested.
\v 28 Then they said to him: What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?
\v 29 Jesus answered and said to them: This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.
\v 30 Therefore, they said to him: What sign do you show, then, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you perform?
\v 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
\p
\v 32 Then Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
\v 33 For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven, and gives life for the world.
\v 34 Then they said to him: Lord, evermore give us this bread.
\v 35 Jesus said to them: I am the bread of life; he that comes to me shall never hunger; he that believes on me shall never thirst.
\v 36 But I said to you, that you have seen me, and yet you do not believe.
\v 37 All that the Father gives me, will come to me; and him that comes to me, I will by no means cast out.
\v 38 For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
\v 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all that he gives me, I shall lose nothing, but shall raise it up at the last day.
\v 40 For this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
\p
\v 41 Then the Jews murmured at him, because he said, I am like bread that came down from heaven.
\v 42 And they said: Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How, then, does he say, I came down from heaven?
\v 43 Jesus answered and said to them: Murmur not among yourselves;
\v 44 no man can come to me, unless the Father, who sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day.
\v 45 It is written in the- prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hears from the Father, and learns, comes to me.
\v 46 Not that any one has seen the Father, but he who is from God; he has seen the Father.
\p
\v 47 Verily, verily I say to you, He that believes on me has eternal life.
\v 48 I am the bread of life.
\v 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.
\v 50 This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that any one may eat of it, and not die.
\v 51 I am the bread that lives, which came down from heaven. If any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
\p
\v 52 The Jews, therefore, contended among themselves, saying: How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
\v 53 Then Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
\v 54 He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day;
\v 55 for my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
\v 56 He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.
\v 57 As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.
\v 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven; not as your fathers ate the manna, and died; he that eats this bread shall live forever.
\p
\v 59 These things he spoke in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
\v 60 Therefore, many of his disciples, when they heard him, said: This is a hard saying; who can hear it?
\v 61 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them: Does this offend you?
\v 62 Then, what if you should see the Son of man go up where he was before?
\v 63 It is the spirit that makes alive; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I speak to you are spirit and life.
\v 64 But there are some among you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who he was that would betray him.
\v 65 And he said: For this reason I said to you: No one can come to me unless it be given him from my Father.
\p
\v 66 After this, many of his disciples went back, and walked with him no more.
\v 67 Then Jesus said to the twelve: Will you also go away?
\v 68 Simon Peter answered him: Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life;
\v 69 and we believe, and know that thou art the Christ, the Son of God.
\v 70 Jesus answered them: Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
\v 71 He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.
\c 7
\cl VII.
\p
\v 1 And after this Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
\p
\v 2 Now the feast of tabernacles, a feast of the Jews, was near.
\v 3 Then his brothers said to him: Depart hence, and go into Judea, that your disciples may see your works which you do;
\v 4 for no one does any thing in secret, while he himself seeks to be before the public. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.
\v 5 For neither did his brothers believe on him.
\v 6 Then Jesus said to them: My time has not yet come; but your time is always ready.
\v 7 The world can not hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.
\v 8 Do you go up to this feast. I go not up now to this feast, because my time has not yet fully come.
\v 9 These things said he to them, and remained in Galilee.
\v 10 But when his brothers had gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.
\p
\v 11 Then the Jews sought for him at the feast, and said: Where is he?
\v 12 And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said: He is a good man. Others said: No; but he deceives the multitude.
\v 13 However, no one spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.
\p
\v 14 Now in the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
\v 15 And the Jews were astonished, and said: How has this man a knowledge of letters, having never been taught?
\v 16 Then Jesus answered and said: My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.
\v 17 If any one will do his will, he shall know with respect to the teaching, whether it is of God, or I speak of myself.
\v 18 He who speaks of himself, seeks his own glory; he who seeks the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
\v 19 Did not Moses give you the law? and not one of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?
\v 20 The multitude answered and said: You have a demon: who seeks to kill you?
\p
\v 21 Jesus answered and said to them: I have done one work, and you are all astonished on account of this.
\v 22 Moses gave you circumcision, (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers,) and you circumcise a man on the sabbath-day.
\v 23 If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath-day, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I have restored the entire man to health on the sabbath-day?
\v 24 Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
\p
\v 25 Then said some of the men of Jerusalem: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
\v 26 and, lo, he is speaking boldly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers really learned that this is the Christ?
\v 27 But we know this man, whence he is. But when the Christ comes, no one knows whence he is.
\p
\v 28 Then Jesus cried out in the temple, as he was teaching, and said: You both know me, and you know whence I am; and I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you know not.
\v 29 But I know him, because I am from him, and he has sent me.
\v 30 Then they sought to take him; yet no one laid his hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
\v 31 And many of the multitude believed on him, and said: When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than these which this man has done?
\p
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and chief priests sent attendants to take him.
\v 33 Then Jesus said to them: Yet a little while I am with you, and I go away to him that sent me.
\v 34 You will seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you can not come.
\v 35 Then the Jews said among themselves: Whither is this man about to go, that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to those who are dispersed among the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?
\v 36 What means this saying which he uttered, You will seek me, and will not find me; and, Where I am you can not come?
\p
\v 37 On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink.
\v 38 He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, from his inner self shall flow rivers of living water.
\v 39 But this he spoke of the Spirit, which those who believe on him were about to receive; for the Holy Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
\v 40 Therefore, many of the multitude, when they had heard this word, said: This is, in truth, the prophet.
\v 41 Others said: This is the Christ. But others said: Does the Christ come out of Galilee?
\v 42 Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from the posterity of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?
\v 43 So there was a division among the multitude because of him.
\v 44 And some of them desired to take him; but no one laid hands on him.
\p
\v 45 Then came the attendants to the chief priests and the Pharisees; and they said to them: Why have you not brought him?
\v 46 The attendants answered: Never did man speak like this man.
\v 47 Then the Pharisees answered them: Are you also deceived?
\v 48 Has any one of the rulers, or of the Pharisees believed on him?
\v 49 But this multitude that know not the law are cursed.
\v 50 Nicodemus said to them (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them):
\v 51 Does our law condemn a man unless it first hear from him, and know what he does?
\v 52 They answered and said to him: Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee arises no prophet.
\p
\v 53 And every one departed to his own house.

\p
\v 1 But Jesus went to the mount of Olives.
\v 2 And in the morning he again entered the temple, and all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.
\v 3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman who had been detected in adultery; and they made her stand in the midst,
\v 4 and said to him: Teacher, this woman was detected in adultery; in the very act.
\v 5 Now Moses, in his law, commanded us, that such should be stoned; but what say you?
\v 6 This they said to tempt him, that they might bring an accusation against him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
\v 7 But as they continued to ask him, he stood up, and said to them: Let him among you who is without sin, first throw a stone at her.
\v 8 And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
\v 9 But having heard him, and being convicted by their conscience, they went out, one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
\v 10 And when Jesus stood up, and saw no one but the woman, he said to her: Woman, where are those who accused you? Has no one condemned you?
\v 11 She said: No one, sir. Jesus said to her: Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more.
\p
\v 12 Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying: I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
\v 13 Then the Pharisees said to him: You testify concerning yourself; your testimony is not worthy of credit.
\v 14 Jesus answered and said to them: Though I testify concerning myself, my testimony is worthy of credit; for I know whence I came, and whither I go. But you know not whence I came, and whither I go.
\v 15 You judge according to the flesh; I judge no man.
\v 16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.
\v 17 It is also written in your law, The testimony of two is worthy of credit.
\v 18 I am one that testify concerning myself, and the Father who sent me, testifies of me.
\p
\v 19 Then they said to him: Where is your Father? Jesus answered: You know neither me, nor my Father. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.
\v 20 These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.
\p
\v 21 Then spoke Jesus to them again; I go away, and you will seek me, and in your sin you shall die; whither I go, you can not come.
\v 22 Then said the Jews: Will he kill himself, because he says, Whither I go, you can not come?
\v 23 And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.
\v 24 Therefore said I to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am, He, you shall die in your sins.
\v 25 Then they said to him: Who are you? And Jesus said to them: The same that I said to you at the beginning.
\v 26 I have many things to say, and to judge with respect to you; but he that sent me is true; and what things I have heard from him, these I speak to the world.
\v 27 They knew not that he was speaking to them of the Father.
\p
\v 28 Then said Jesus to them: When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things.
\v 29 And he that sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him.
\p
\v 30 While he was speaking these words, many believed on him.
\v 31 Then said Jesus to those Jews that believed on him: If you continue in my word, you are my disciples indeed,
\v 32 and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
\v 33 They answered him: We are the posterity of Abraham, and have never been in bondage to any one. How say you, You shall be made free?
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered them: Verily, verily I say to you, whoever works sin is the servant of sin.
\v 35 The servant continues not in the house forever; but the Son continues forever.
\v 36 Therefore, if the Son make you free, you shall be free indeed.
\v 37 I know that you are the posterity of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
\v 38 I speak what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have seen with your father.
\v 39 They answered and said to him: Abra ham is our father.
\p Jesus said to them: If you were the children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.
\v 40 But now you seek to kill me, a man that has spoken to you the truth, which I have heard from God; this Abraham did not.
\v 41 You do the works of your father. They said to him: We were not born of lewdness; we have one father, God.
\p
\v 42 Jesus said to them: If God were your father, you would love me; for I came forth from God and have come hither; nor, indeed, did I come of myself, but he sent me.
\v 43 Why do you not know what I say? Because you can not understand my words.
\v 44 You are of your father, the devil; and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks that which is false, he speaks from what is his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.
\v 45 But because I speak the truth, you believe me not.
\v 46 Which of you convicts me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?
\v 47 He that is of God, hears God’s words. For this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God.
\p
\v 48 The Jews answered, and said to him: Do we not well say that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?
\v 49 Jesus answered: I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
\v 50 I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeks and judges.
\v 51 Verily, verily I say to you, if any one will keep my word, he shall never see death.
\p
\v 52 Then said the Jews to him: Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
\v 53 Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead; whom do you make yourself?
\p
\v 54 Jesus answered: If I honor myself, my honor is nothing; it is my Father that honors me, of whom you say, that he is your God.
\v 55 And yet you have not known him. But I know him; and if I should say that I do not know him, I should be like yourselves, a liar. But I know him, and I keep his word.
\v 56 Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he could see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
\v 57 Then the Jews said to him: You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?
\p
\v 58 Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I was.
\v 59 Then they took up stones to throw at him. But Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them; and so passed by.

\p
\v 1 And as he passed by, he saw a man that had been blind from his birth.
\v 2 And his disciples asked him, saying: Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
\v 3 Jesus answered: Neither this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God might be made manifest in him.
\v 4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day; the night comes, when no man can work.
\v 5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
\v 6 Having said this, he spit on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on the eyes of the blind man,
\v 7 and said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloam; which, translated, means Sent. He went, therefore, and washed and came seeing.
\p
\v 8 Then his neighbors, and those who had before seen him, that he was blind, said: Is not this he that sat and begged?
\v 9 Some said: It is he. Others: He is like him. But he said: I am he.
\v 10 Then they said to him: How were your eyes opened?
\v 11 He answered and said: A man called Jesus made clay and spread it on my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. After I had gone and washed, I received my sight.
\v 12 Then they said to him: Where is he? He said: I know not.
\p
\v 13 They brought to the Pharisees him that had formerly been blind.
\v 14 And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
\v 15 Then again the Pharisees also inquired of him how he had received his sight. He said to them: He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.
\v 16 Then some of the Pharisees said: This man is not from God, for he keeps not the sabbath. Others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them?
\p
\v 17 Again they said to the blind man: What say you of him, seeing that he opened your eyes? He said: He is a prophet.
\v 18 The Jews did not, therefore, believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, till they called the parents of him that had received his sight,
\v 19 and asked them, saying: Is this your son, who, you say, was born blind? How, then, does he now see?
\v 20 His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
\v 21 but how he now sees we know not; or who opened his eyes we know not. He is of age; ask him; he will speak for himself.
\p
\v 22 His parents said this, because they feared the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed, that if any one should confess him to be the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
\v 23 For this reason his parents said: He is of age; ask him.
\p
\v 24 Then, the second time, they called the man who had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.
\v 25 He answered and said: If he is a sinner, I know it not. One thing I do know, that having been blind, I now see.
\v 26 They said to him again: What did he for you? How did he open your eyes?
\v 27 He answered them: I have already told you, and you did not understand; why would you hear it again? Do you also wish to become his disciples?
\v 28 They reviled him, and said: You are the disciple of that man; but we are the disciples of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God spoke to Moses; but as for this man, we know not whence he is.
\p
\v 30 The man answered and said to them: Why, there is some thing wonderful in this, that you know not whence he is, and yet he has opened my eyes.
\v 31 We know that God hears not sinners; but if any one be a worshiper of God, and do his will, him he hears.
\v 32 Since the beginning it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one who had been born blind.
\v 33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
\v 34 They answered and said to him: You were wholly born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.
\p
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out. And having found him, he said to him: Do you believe on the Son of God?
\v 36 He answered and said: Who is he, sir, that I may believe on him?
\v 37 Jesus said to him: You have seen him; and it is he that talks with you.
\v 38 He said: Lord, I believe; and he worshiped him.
\v 39 And Jesus said: For judgment have I come into this world, that those who see not, may see; and that those who see, may become blind.
\p
\v 40 And some of the Pharisees who were with him, heard these things, and said to him: Are we also blind?
\v 41 Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you would not have sin; but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.

\v 1 Verily, verily I say to you, he that goes not through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief, and a robber.
\v 2 But he that enters through the door, is the shepherd of the sheep.
\v 3 To him the door-keeper opens; and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
\v 4 And when he puts his own sheep out, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him; for they know his voice.
\v 5 And a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers.
\p
\v 6 This parable spoke Jesus to them; but they knew not the meaning of the things which he spoke to them.
\v 7 Therefore Jesus spoke again to them: Verily, verily I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
\v 8 All that came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them.
\v 9 I am the door: if any one enters through me, he shall be saved; and he shall go in and out, and find pasture.
\v 10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in abundance.
\v 11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
\v 12 But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, to whom the sheep do not belong, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep, and scatters them.
\v 13 The hireling flees because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep.
\p
\v 14 I am the good shepherd, and I know my sheep, and am known by mine.
\v 15 As the Father knows me, I also know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.
\v 16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; those, also, must I bring, and they will hear my voice: and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.
\v 17 For this reason, my Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.
\v 18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I have received from my Father.
\p
\v 19 Again, therefore, there was a division among the Jews, on account of these words.
\v 20 And many of them said: He has a demon, and is mad; why do you hear him?
\v 21 Others said: These are not the words of one that has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
\p
\v 22 And the feast of the dedication was celebrated in Jerusalem, and it was winter:
\v 23 and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.
\p
\v 24 Then the Jews came round him, and said to him: How long do you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.
\v 25 Jesus answered them: I have told you, and you do not believe. The works which I do in my Father’s name, these testify of me.
\v 26 But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep. As I said to you,
\v 27 my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
\v 28 and I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall take them out of my hand.
\v 29 My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to take them out of my Father’s hand.
\v 30 I and my Father are one.
\p
\v 31 Then the Jews took up stones again, to stone him.
\v 32 Jesus answered them: Many good works have I showed you from my Father: for which of these works do you stone me?
\v 33 The Jews answered and said to him: We do not stone you for a good work, but for your impious words; and because you, being man, make yourself God.
\v 34 Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law, I said, you are gods?
\v 35 If he called them gods, to whom the word of God was committed, (and the scripture can not be made void,)
\v 36 do you say of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You speak impiously, because I said, I am the Son of God?
\v 37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not;
\v 38 but if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.
\p
\v 39 Then they sought again to take him, but he escaped from their hands.
\v 40 And he went away again beyond the Jordan, to the place where John first immersed, and there he abode.
\v 41 And many came to him, and said: John did no sign; but all things that John said of this man were true.
\v 42 And many who were there believed on him.

\p
\v 1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus, of Bethany, the village of Mary and Martha her sister.
\v 2 It was the Mary that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
\v 3 Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
\p
\v 4 But when Jesus heard it, he said: This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that by it the Son of God may be glorified.
\v 5 Now, Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
\v 6 When, therefore, he heard that he was sick, he still remained two days in the place where he was.
\v 7 Then after this, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.
\v 8 His disciples said to him: Rabbi, the Jews just now sought to stone thee, and art thou going thither again?
\v 9 Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks during the day, he does not stumble, for he sees the light of this world.
\v 10 But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.
\p
\v 11 Thus spoke he; and after this he said to them: Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.
\v 12 Then his disciples said: Lord, if he sleeps, he will be saved.
\v 13 Jesus spoke of his death; but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
\v 14 Therefore, Jesus then said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.
\v 15 And I rejoice, on your account, that I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him.
\v 16 Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.
\p
\v 17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had already been four days in the tomb.
\v 18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.
\v 19 And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
\v 20 Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went out to meet him; but Mary sat still in the house.
\v 21 Then Martha said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here my brother would not have died.
\v 22 But even now, I know that whatever thou wilt ask of God, God will give thee.
\p
\v 23 Jesus said to her: Your brother shall rise again.
\v 24 Martha said to him: I know that he will rise, in the resurrection at the last day.
\v 25 Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection, and the life; he that believes on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;
\v 26 and he that lives and believes on me, shall never die. Do you believe this?
\v 27 She said to him: Yes, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.
\p
\v 28 And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying: The Teacher has come, and calls for you.
\v 29 When she heard it, she rose quickly and came to him.
\v 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.
\v 31 Then the Jews that were with her in the house, and were comforting her, seeing Mary rise and go out quickly, followed her, saying: She is going to the tomb to weep there.
\v 32 Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.
\p
\v 33 Then, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews that came with her weeping also, he was greatly moved in spirit, and troubled;
\v 34 and he said: Where have you laid him? They said to him: Lord, come and see.
\v 35 Jesus wept.
\v 36 Then said the Jews: See how he loved him!
\v 37 And some of them said: Could not he, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have caused that even this man should not have died?
\v 38 Then Jesus, again greatly moved within himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was laid against it.
\v 39 Jesus said: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said to him: Lord, the body is offensive; for he has been dead four days.
\p
\v 40 Jesus said to her: Did I not tell you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?
\v 41 Then they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted -up his eyes and said: Father, I thank thee, that thou hast heard me.
\v 42 I know, in deed, that thou dost always hear me. But for the sake of the multitude who stand around me, I have said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
\v 43 And when he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
\v 44 And he that had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound around with a handkerchief. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.
\p
\v 45 Then many of the Jews that had come to Mary, and who saw what he had done, believed on him.
\v 46 But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.
\p
\v 47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called together the Sanhedrin, and said: What are we doing? For this man does many signs.
\v 48 If we thus let him alone, all will believe on him, and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation.
\v 49 But one of them, Caiaphas, who was chief priest that year, said to them: You know nothing,
\v 50 nor do you consider that it is profitable for us, that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.
\v 51 But this he did not speak of himself; but being chief priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation;
\v 52 and not for the nation only, but that he should gather into one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
\v 53 From that day, therefore, they consulted together to put him to death.
\p
\v 54 Therefore, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but withdrew thence to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he remained with his disciples.
\v 55 And the passover of the Jews was near; and many went up from the country to Jerusalem, before the passover, to purify themselves.
\v 56 Then they sought for Jesus, and said one to another, as they stood in the temple: What think you, that he will not come to the feast?
\v 57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders, that, if any one knew where he was, he should inform them, that they might take him.
\c 12
\cl XII.
\p
\v 1 Then, six days before the passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 2 There they made him a supper, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with him.
\p
\v 3 Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the perfume of the ointment.
\v 4 Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, who was about to deliver him up:
\v 5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?
\v 6 But he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and took what was put in it.
\v 7 Then Jesus said: Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of my burial.
\v 8 For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.
\p
\v 9 Therefore, a great multitude of the Jews learned that he was there; and they came, not on account of Jesus only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 10 But the chief priests consulted that they might kill Lazarus also,
\v 11 because on account of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
\p
\v 12 On the next day, a great multitude that had come to the feast, having heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,
\v 13 took branches of palm-trees, and went out to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is the king of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.
\v 14 And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon him, as it is written:
\v 15 Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king comes, sitting on the colt of an ass.
\v 16 His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.
\p
\v 17 The multitude therefore that was with him, testified that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.
\v 18 For this reason, also, the multitude met him, because they had heard that he had done this sign.
\v 19 Then the Pharisees said among themselves: You see that you gain nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.
\p
\v 20 Among those who came to worship at the feast were certain Greeks.
\v 21 These then came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying: Sir, we wish to see Jesus.
\v 22 Philip came and told Andrew; and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
\v 23 But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour has come that the Son of man must be glorified.
\v 24 Verily, verily I say to you, unless a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remains alone; but if it die, it produces much fruit.
\v 25 He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to eternal life.
\v 26 If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant also be. If any one serve me, him will my Father honor.
\p
\v 27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But for this purpose came I to this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify thy name. Then there came a voice from heaven: I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.
\v 29 Then the multitude that stood by and heard it, said: It thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.
\v 30 Jesus answered and said: This voice came not for my sake, but for yours.
\v 31 Now is the judgment of this world: now is the prince of this world cast out.
\v 32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.
\v 33 This he said, signifying what death he was about to die.
\p
\v 34 The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that the Christ remains forever: and how say you that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
\v 35 Then Jesus said to them: Yet a little while is the light with you: walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you. For he that walks in the darkness knows not whither he goes.
\v 36 While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become the sons of light. These things spoke Jesus, and he departed, and concealed himself from them.
\p
\v 37 But though he had done so many signs in their presence, yet they believed not on him,
\v 38 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
\v 39 For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:
\v 40 He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and should turn, and I should give them health.
\v 41 These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
\v 42 But yet, many even of the rulers believed on him; but on account of the Pharisees, they would not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;
\v 43 for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
\p
\v 44 Jesus cried, and said: He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.
\v 45 And he that sees me, sees him that sent me.
\v 46 I have come a light into the world, that he who believes on me, may not remain in darkness.
\v 47 And if any one hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
\v 48 He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has that which judges him: the word which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the last day.
\v 49 For I have not spoken of myself: but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.
\v 50 And I know that his commandment is life eternal. What things I speak therefore, as the Father has said to me, so I speak.
\c 13
\cl XIII.
\p
\v 1 Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come that he must go out of this world to his Father; and having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them to the end.
\v 2 And supper being over, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to deliver him up,
\v 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had delivered all things into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was going to God,
\v 4 arose from supper, and laid aside his garments, and taking a towel, he girded himself.
\v 5 Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash his disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.
\p
\v 6 Then he came to Simon Peter; and Peter said to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
\v 7 Jesus answered and said to him: What I am doing you know not now, but you will know hereafter.
\v 8 Peter said to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him: Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.
\v 9 Simon Peter said to him: Lord, not my feet only, but my hands and my head.
\v 10 Jesus said to him: He that has bathed needs nothing else save to wash his feet, but is wholly clean. And you are clean, but not all.
\v 11 For he knew who would deliver him up; for this reason he said, You are not all clean.
\p
\v 12 Therefore, when he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, he reclined at table again, and said to them: Do you understand what I have done for you?
\v 13 You call me Teacher and Lord; and you say well, for so I am.
\v 14 If, then, I, your Lord and your Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
\v 15 For I have given you an example, that you also may do as I have done for you.
\v 16 Verily, verily I say to you, the servant is not greater than his master, nor is he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, blessed are you, if you do them.
\v 18 I speak not of you all. I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.
\v 19 I tell you this now, before it comes to pass, that when it comes to pass, you may believe that I am he.
\p
\v 20 Verily, verily I say to you, he that receives him that I shall send, receives me; and he that receives me, receives him that sent me.
\p
\v 21 When Jesus had spoken these things, he was troubled in spirit, and testified and said: Verily, verily I say to you, that one of you will deliver me up.
\v 22 Then the disciples looked at one another, doubting of whom he spoke.
\v 23 There was reclining on the bosom of Jesus, one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
\v 24 Then Simon Peter beckoned to this one, that he should inquire who it was of whom he spoke.
\v 25 And he that was reclining on Jesus breast, said to him: Lord, who is it?
\p
\v 26 Jesus answered: It is he to whom I shall give this morsel after I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
\v 27 And after the morsel \add was given\add*, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him: What you do, do quickly.
\v 28 But none of those who reclined at table with him knew for what purpose he said this to him.
\v 29 For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy what we need for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
\v 30 Then, on receiving the morsel, he immediately went out; and it was night.
\p
\v 31 When he had gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
\v 32 If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will immediately glorify him.
\v 33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and, as I said to the Jews, whither I go, you can not come, so now I say to you.
\v 34 A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
\v 35 By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.
\p
\v 36 Simon Peter said to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him: Whither I go, you can not follow me now; but you shall follow me hereafter.
\v 37 Peter said to him: Lord, why can I not follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.
\v 38 Jesus answered him: Will you lay down your life for me? Verily, verily I say to you, the cock will not crow till you have denied me three times.
\c 14
\cl XIV.
\p
\v 1 Let not your heart be troubled; believe in God; believe also in me.
\v 2 In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
\v 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you with myself, that where I am, you may be also.
\v 4 And whither I go you know, and the way you know.
\p
\v 5 Thomas said to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest, and how can we know the way?
\v 6 Jesus said to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through me.
\v 7 If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. And from this time you know him, and have seen him.
\p
\v 8 Philip said to him: Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be content.
\v 9 Jesus said to him: Have I been so long with you, and have you not known me, Philip? He that has seen me, has seen the Father; and how say you, Show us the Father?
\v 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself. The Father who dwells in me, he does the works.
\v 11 Believe me, that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me. If not, believe me on account of the works themselves.
\v 12 Verily, verily I say to you, he that believes on me, the works that I do he also shall do. Even greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my Father;
\v 13 and whatever you ask in my name, I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\v 14 If you ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
\p
\v 15 If you love me, keep my commandments;
\v 16 and I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Paraclete, that he may dwell with you forever;
\v 17 the Spirit of the truth, whom the world can not receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, because he dwells with you, and shall be in you.
\v 18 I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.
\v 19 Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you shall see me. Because I live, you also shall live.
\v 20 In that clay you shall know that I am in my Father, arid you in me, and I in you.
\v 21 He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; and he that loves me shall be loved by my Father; and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
\p
\v 22 Judas, not Iscariot, said to him: Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?
\v 23 Jesus answered and said to him: If any one loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.
\v 24 He that loves me not, keeps not my words; and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
\p
\v 25 These things have I spoken to you, while I am yet with you.
\v 26 But the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I have spoken to you.
\v 27 Peace I leave to you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, and let it not be afraid.
\v 28 You have heard that I said to you, I am going away, and am coming again to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I go to the Father; for my Father is greater than I.
\v 29 And now I have told you before it comes to pass, that when it does come to pass, you may believe.
\v 30 I will not talk much more with you; for the prince of this world is coming, and has nothing in me.
\v 31 But \add this takes place\add* that the world may know that I love the Father, and even as he gave me commandment, so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
\c 15
\cl XV.
\p
\v 1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine-dresser.
\v 2 Every branch in me that bears no fruit, he takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
\v 3 Now are you pure, through the word which I have spoken to you.
\v 4 Abide in me, and I will abide in you. As the branch can not bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in me.
\v 5 I am the vine, you are the branches. He that abides in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; for apart from me you can do nothing.
\p
\v 6 If any one abide not in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and withers; and such are gathered, and thrown into the fire, and burned.
\v 7 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done for you.
\v 8 In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and in this you will be my disciples.
\v 9 As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love.
\v 10 If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.
\p
\v 11 These things have I spoken to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.
\v 12 This is my commandment: That you love one another, as I have loved you.
\v 13 Greater love has no man than this, that one should lay down his life for his friends.
\v 14 You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.
\v 15 I no longer call you servants, because the servant knows not what his master does. But I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you.
\v 16 You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you, that you may go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit may remain; that whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he may give you.
\v 17 These things I command you, that you may love one another.
\p
\v 18 If the world hates you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.
\v 19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
\v 20 Remember the word which I spoke to you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.
\v 21 But all these things they will do to you on my account, because they know not him that sent me.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
\v 23 He that hates me, hates my Father also.
\v 24 If I had not done among them the works that no other man has done, they would have had no sin; but now they have both seen, and hated both me and my Father.
\v 25 But this is so, that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
\p
\v 26 But when the Paraclete has come, whom I will send to you from my Father, the Spirit of the truth, which proceeds from the Father, he will testify of me;
\v 27 and you also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
\c 16
\cl XVI.
\p
\v 1 These things have I spoken to you, that you may not be ensnared.
\v 2 They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed, the time is coming, when he that kills you, will think that he is offering service to God.
\v 3 And these things they will do, because they know neither the Father nor me.
\v 4 But these things I have told you, that, when the time has come, you may remember that I told you of them. But these things I did not tell you at the beginning, because I was with you.
\v 5 And now I go to him that sent me, and no one of you asks me, Whither goest thou?
\v 6 But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
\p
\v 7 But yet I tell you the truth: it is profitable for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the Paraclete will not come to you. But if I go away, I will send him to you.
\v 8 And when he has come, he will convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.
\v 9 Of sin, because they believe not on me;
\v 10 of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no more;
\v 11 of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
\p
\v 12 I have yet many things to say to you; but you can not bear them now.
\v 13 But when he, the Spirit of the truth, has come, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak of himself; but what he hears, that will he speak, and he will show you things to come.
\v 14 He will glorify me; for he will take of mine, and show it to you.
\v 15 All things that the Father has are mine; for this reason I said, that he will take of mine, and show it to you.
\v 16 A little while, and you will not see me; and again, a little while, and you will see me, because I go to the Father.
\p
\v 17 Then some of his disciples said one to another: What is this that he says to us, A little while, and - you will not see me; and again, a little while, and you will see me? and, Be cause I go to the Father?
\v 18 Therefore they said: What is this that he says, The little while? We know not what he says.
\v 19 Then Jesus knew that they wished to ask him; and he said to them: Are you inquiring of one another about this, because I said, A little while and you will not see me; and again, a little while, and you will see me?
\v 20 Verily, verily I say to you, you shall weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
\v 21 A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow, be cause her hour has come; but when the child is born, she no longer remembers the pain, for joy that a man is born into the world.
\v 22 You, therefore, have sorrow now; but I shall see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you.
\v 23 And in that day you shall ask nothing of me; verily, verily I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give you.
\v 24 Till this time you have asked for nothing in my name; ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.
\p
\v 25 These things I have spoken to you in parables; the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in parables, but will teach you plainly concerning the Father.
\v 26 In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father in your behalf;
\v 27 for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.
\v 28 I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world: again I leave the world, and go to the Father.
\p
\v 29 His disciples said to him: Lo, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no parable.
\v 30 Now we know that thou knowest all things, and hast no need that any one should ask thee. By this we believe that thou hast come forth from God.
\v 31 Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?
\v 32 Behold, the hour is coming, and has now come, in which you shall be scattered, each one to his own home, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
\v 33 These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have affliction, but be of good courage; I have overcome the world.
\c 17
\cl XVII.
\p
\v 1 Jesus spoke these words, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said: Father, the hour has come: glorify thy Son, that thy Son may also glorify thee;
\v 2 as thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all that thou hast given him.
\v 3 And this is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.
\v 4 I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
\v 5 And now, Father, glorify me with thyself, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
\p
\v 6 I have made known thy name to the men that thou gavest me out of the world. Thine they were, and thou gavest them, to me, and they have kept thy word.
\v 7 Now they know that all things that thou hast given me are from thee;
\v 8 for the words which thou gavest me I have given them; and they have received them, and they know surely that I came forth from thee, and they believe that thou didst send me.
\v 9 I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me; for they are thine.
\v 10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.
\v 11 And I am no longer in the world; but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep in thy name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are one.
\v 12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name. Those whom thou gavest me, I have kept; and none of them is lost but the son of perdition, that the scripture may be fulfilled.
\v 13 And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
\p
\v 14 I have given them thy word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
\v 15 I do not pray thee to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the Evil One.
\v 16 They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
\v 17 Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.
\v 18 As thou hast sent me into the world, so I send them into the world;
\v 19 and for them I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.
\v 20 I pray, not for these only, but for those also who shall believe on me through their word;
\v 21 that they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
\v 22 And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one;
\v 23 I in them, and thou ID me, that they may be made perfect in one, that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.
\p
\v 24 Father, I wish that they also, whom thou hast given me, may be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me; for thou didst love me before the foundation of the world.
\v 25 Righteous Father, though the world has not known thee, yet I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
\v 26 And I have made known to them thy name, and will continue to make it known, that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.

\v 1 When Jesus had spoken these things, he went out with his disciples beyond the brook Kedron, where was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.
\v 2 And Judas, who delivered him up, also knew the place, because Jesus often went thither with his disciples.
\v 3 Judas, then, having received the band of soldiers and attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees, came thither with torches and lamps and weapons.
\p
\v 4 Then Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth, and said to them: Whom do you seek?
\v 5 They answered him: Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said to them: I am he. Judas, also, who delivered him up, was standing among them.
\v 6 Then, when he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
\v 7 Then he asked them again: Whom do you seek? They said: Jesus the Nazarene.
\v 8 Jesus answered: I have told you that I am he. If, then, you seek me, let these go away.
\v 9 \add This he said,\add* that the word might be fulfilled which he had spoken: Of those whom thou hast given me; I have lost none.
\p
\v 10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his right ear. The name of the servant was Malchus.
\v 11 Then Jesus said to Peter: Put up your sword into its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup that my Father has given me?
\p
\v 12 Then the band of soldiers, and the officer, and the attendants of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him,
\v 13 and led him first to Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was chief priest that year.
\v 14 It was Caiaphas who had given counsel to the Jews, that it was profitable that one man should die for the people.
\p
\v 15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. And that other disciple was acquainted with the chief priest, and he went in with Jesus into the palace of the chief priest.
\v 16 But Peter stood without near the door. Then the other disciple, who was acquainted with the chief priest, went out and spoke to the door-keeper, and brought Peter in.
\v 17 Then the maid-servant who kept the door said to Peter: Are you not also one of the disciples of this man? He said: I am not.
\v 18 And the servants and the attendants, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, were standing and warming themselves. And Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
\p
\v 19 Then the chief priest questioned Jesus concerning his disciples and his teaching.
\v 20 Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews come together, and in secret I have spoken nothing.
\v 21 Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard, what things I said to them. Behold, they know what I have said.
\v 22 When he had spoken thus, one of the attendants, who was standing by, struck Jesus with his open hand, saying: Do you answer the chief priest thus?
\v 23 Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you strike me?
\v 24 Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.
\p
\v 25 And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him: Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied, and said: I am not.
\v 26 One of the servants of the chief priest, who was a kinsman of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said: Did I not see you in the garden with him?
\v 27 Then Peter denied again. And immediately the cock crew.
\p
\v 28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s palace. It was the morning hour. And, in order that they might not be denied, but that they might eat the passover, they did not go into the governor’s palace.
\v 29 Then Pilate came out to them, and said: What accusation do you bring against this man?
\v 30 They answered and said to him: If this man were not an evil-doer, we would not have delivered him to you.
\v 31 Then Pilate said to them: Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. Then the Jews said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any one to death;
\v 32 that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what death he was about to die.
\p
\v 33 Then Pilate again entered the governor’s palace, and called Jesus, and said to him: Are you the king of the Jews?
\v 34 Jesus answered him: Do you say this of yourself, or did others speak to you of me?
\v 35 Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Your own nation, and the chief priests have delivered you to me; what have you done?
\v 36 Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I might not be delivered up to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not hence.
\v 37 Then Pilate said to him: You are a king, then? Jesus answered; You say that I am a king. For this purpose was I born, and for this purpose I came into the world, that I might testify to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, hears my voice.
\v 38 Pilate said to him: What is truth?
\p And when he had said this, he again came out to the Jews, and said to them: I find no fault in him.
\v 39 But you have a custom, that I release to you one during the passover. Are you willing, then, that I should release to you the king of the Jews?
\v 40 They all, then, cried out, saying: Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
\c 19
\cl XIX.
\p
\v 1 Then Pilate, therefore, took Jesus and scourged him.
\v 2 And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorn-branches, and put it upon his head; and they put on him a purple robe,
\v 3 and said: Hail, King of the Jews. And they struck him with their open hands.
\p
\v 4 Then Pilate came out again, and said to them: Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him.
\v 5 Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorn branches, and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them: Be hold the man!
\v 6 When the chief priests and their attendants saw him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said to them: Do you take him and crucify him; for I find no fault in him.
\v 7 The Jews answered: We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
\p
\v 8 Then, when Pilate heard this word, he was the more afraid;
\v 9 and he went into the governor’s palace again, and said to Jesus: Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.
\v 10 Then Pilate said to him: Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you, and authority to release you?
\v 11 Jesus answered: You could have no authority over me, had it not been given you from above. Therefore, he that delivered me to you, has the greater sin.
\p
\v 12 After this Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If you release this man, you are not Cæsar’s friend. Every one that makes himself a king, speaks against Cæsar
\v 13 Then Pilate, when he heard that word, led Jesus out, and sat on the judgment-seat, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha;
\v 14 it was the preparation for the passover, and about the third hour; and he said to the Jews, Behold your king!
\v 15 But they cried out: Away with him, away with him; crucify him! Pilate said to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Cæsar
\v 16 Then he, therefore, delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.
\p
\v 17 And, bearing his cross, he went forth into a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called, in Hebrew, Golgotha,
\v 18 where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.
\p
\v 19 And Pilate wrote a superscription, and put it on the cross; and the writing was, JESUS THE NAZABENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\v 20 Therefore many of the Jews read this superscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Hebrew and in Greek and in Latin.
\v 21 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write not, The king of the Jews; but, that he said, I am the king of the Jews.
\v 22 Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written.
\v 23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothing, and made four parts, to each soldier a part; and they took his coat also. Now his coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
\v 24 Then they said, one to another, let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. \add This was done\add* that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says: They divided my clothing among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. The soldiers, therefore, did these things.
\p
\v 25 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
\v 26 Then Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by, said to his mother: Woman, behold your son.
\v 27 Then he said to the disciple: Behold your mother. And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.
\p
\v 28 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst.
\v 29 Now a vessel full of vinegar had been set there; and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon a hyssop-stalk, and put it to his mouth.
\v 30 Therefore, when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said: It is finished. And he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
\p
\v 31 Then the Jews, as it was the preparation, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for that sabbath-day was a great day, besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken down.
\v 32 Then came the soldiers and broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him.
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs:
\v 34 but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear; and immediately there came out blood and water.
\p
\v 35 And he that saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he speaks the truth, that you may believe;
\v 36 for these things were done that the scripture might be fulfilled: A bone of him shall not be broken.
\v 37 And again another scripture says: They shall look on him whom they pierced.
\p
\v 38 And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him permission. He then came and took away the body of Jesus.
\v 39 Then came Nicodemus also, (who, at the first, had come to Jesus by night,) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
\v 40 Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, according to the Jewish custom of burying.
\v 41 Now, in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.
\v 42 There, then, on account of the preparation-day of the Jews, they laid Jesus, for the tomb was near.
\c 20
\cl XX.
\p
\v 1 And early on the first day of the week, while it was yet dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
\v 2 Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them: They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.
\v 3 Then Peter and the other disciple went out, and came to the tomb.
\p
\v 4 And the two ran together; and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;
\v 5 and he stooped down and saw the linen cloths lying, but he did not go in.
\v 6 Then came Simon Peter, following him; and he went into the tomb, and saw the linen cloths lying,
\v 7 and the handkerchief that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded in a place by itself.
\v 8 Then, therefore, the other disciple, who came first to the tomb, went in, and saw, and believed.
\v 9 For, as yet, they did not know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
\v 10 Then the disciples went away again by themselves.
\p
\v 11 But Mary stood without near the tomb, weeping; and as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the tomb,
\v 12 and saw two angels in white raiment, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the foot, where the body of Jesus had lain.
\v 13 And they said to her: Woman, why do you weep? She said to them: They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
\v 14 Having said this, she turned back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Jesus said to her: Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? Supposing that it was the gardener, she said to him: Sir, if you have taken him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.
\v 16 Jesus said to her: Mary. She turned, and said to him: Rabboni; which is, translated, Teacher.
\v 17 Jesus said to her: Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.
\v 18 Mary Magdalen came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
\p
\v 19 Then, on that day, the first day of the week, when it was evening, and the doors of the house in which the disciples were assembled had been closed for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: Peace be to you.
\v 20 And having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced, when they saw the Lord.
\v 21 Then Jesus said to them again: Peace be to you. As my Father has sent me, so I send you.
\v 22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them: Receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 23 Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them: whosever sins you retain, they are retained.
\p
\v 24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
\v 25 Then the other disciples said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger in the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
\p
\v 26 And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas was with them. Then Jesus came, though the doors had been closed, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you.
\v 27 Then he said to Thomas: Reach hither your finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither your hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.
\v 28 And Thomas answered and said to him: My Lord and my God.
\v 29 Jesus said to him: Because you have seen me you have believed: blessed are they who, though they have not seen, yet have believed.
\p
\v 30 Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;
\v 31 but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life through his name.
\c 21

\p
\v 1 After this, Jesus showed himself again to his disciples, at the sea of Tiberias. And he showed himself in this way.
\v 2 There were together, Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathaniel of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.
\v 3 Simon Peter said to them: I am going a fishing. They said to him: We also are going with you. They went out and entered the ship; and that night they caught nothing.
\p
\v 4 But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
\v 5 Then Jesus said to them: Children, have you any food? They answered him: No.
\v 6 He said to them: Throw the net on the right side of the ship, and you will find. They threw it, there fore, and were no longer able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
\v 7 Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: It is the Lord. And when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girded on his outer coat, for he had on his inner garment only, and threw himself into the sea.
\v 8 And the other disciples came in a little ship, dragging the net with fishes, for they were not far from the land, only about two hundred cubits.
\p
\v 9 As soon as they had come to the land, they saw there a fire of coals, and fish lying upon it, and bread.
\v 10 Jesus said to them; Bring of the fish that you have just taken.
\v 11 Simon Peter went and drew the net to the land, full of large fishes, a hundred and fifty-three. And though they were so many, the net did not break.
\v 12 Jesus said to them: Come and breakfast. But no one of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? because they knew it was the Lord.
\v 13 Then Jesus came and took the bread, and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
\v 14 This was now the third occasion on which Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
\p
\v 15 When, therefore, they had taken breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter: Simon, son of Jonah, Do you love me more than these? He said to him: Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Feed my lambs.
\v 16 He said to him again a second time: Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? He said to him: Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Be a shepherd to my sheep.
\v 17 He said to him a third time: Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do you love me? And he said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said to him: Feed my sheep.
\v 18 Verily, verily I say to you, when you were young, you girded yourself, and walked whither you chose; but when you have become old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and lead you whither you would not.
\v 19 But this he said, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said to him: Follow me.
\p
\v 20 Then Peter, turning about, saw the disciple that Jesus loved, following, who also reclined at supper upon his breast, and said: Lord, who is he that delivers thee up?
\v 21 Peter seeing this one, said to Jesus: Lord, what shall this one do?
\v 22 Jesus said to him: If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you? Do you follow me.
\v 23 Therefore, this saying went out among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you?
\p
\v 24 This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.
\v 25 And there are also many other things that Jesus did; if they should be written, every one of them, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written.
